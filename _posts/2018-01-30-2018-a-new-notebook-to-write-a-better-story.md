# 2018 - A new notebook to write a better story

Well the credit for the title totally goes to this [motivational video](https://www.facebook.com/gaurgopald/videos/1073174056156311/) on Facebook. The video has great short message that life has given us a blank notebook in the form of year 2018. Go use it, the best way!

I had enough of Apps Dev stuff in 2015. I made a resolution in Dec'15 itself for the 2016 - Become a better developer, learn AngularJS, Node.js, Clear MongoDB certification and Brush up HTML & CSS. This doesn't mean I was not learning much before that. IMO resolutions help you to set your vision and goals. If you achieve them, you get satisfaction. If you don't achieve them, you will at least have guilt in your heart for not standing by even to your personal commitments. That guilt factor would increase the probability of fulfilling those goals.

The resolution strategy to learn something new, something specific worked for me. Although, I am flexible enough to add something new to the resolutions list, if required. That flexibility helped me to remove the WordPress development and add Gulp.js and Jenkins to the learning resolutions list in 2017.

I have seen many developers who are tired and frustrated from the age old technologies and tools, they work on. But at the same time, they are not aware about the current technology stacks and trends. By this post, I am just trying to list down all the tips, tools, and technologies that can straightaway go to your resolutions list for 2018 and in turn makes you a better developer.

### **Quick and easy ways to be a better developer**

**Follow other great developers on Twitter**
There are thousands of active developers on twitter who share tons of amazing stuff. My primary source of knowing some new technology is mostly Twitter only.

**Ask for code reviews**
This is another easy way to learn from your mistakes by getting reviewed your code by someone you feel is more well-versed in programming.

**Coding etiquettes**
Coding etiquettes is nothing but writing code in a neat way. Add helpful comments, indentation, spacing, and try to have a sensible naming convention. All these habits will make your code legible and lovable to the future maintainers.

**Master your IDE**
Average developer would be spending much more time with IDE than his/her spouse. That's a cruel fact! Mastering the shortcuts and advanced features will surely boost your productivity and consume less time. All the latest IDEs support extensions, multiline editing, [Emmet](https://emmet.io/), auto formatters, [file and folder icons](https://code.visualstudio.com/blogs/2016/09/08/icon-themes), [select all instances of the selected text](https://twitter.com/pcgeek86/status/947658027372396544) for a quick refactoring, built in Git, built in terminal/command line tool, etc. Checkout [Visual Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/), [Sublime Text 3](https://www.sublimetext.com/3) or [Atom](https://atom.io/)!

**Journal your findings, learnings or course notes**
Writing notes about your findings or taking course notes would help you to revise those notes at some point of time in future. I have decided this year to notedown almost everything inside Microsoft OneNote and some useful stuffs on [my blog](http://manadaym.github.io/).

**Make your brand**
You can be a damn genious developer who can easily write complex logic, algorithms or can solve programming puzzles. But world know nothing about you because of your zero online presence. We're mostly active on Facebook, Twitter or Instagram but our most of the social content revolves around burger-pizza photos, weird selfies and ranting about poor services by restaurants or shoppig sites. IMO, dedicating at least one social channel only for your passion increases your value and online presence. I decided to use my twitter handle to share mostly programming stuff. That gradually helped me to get new followers who share the same passion.

### **The long way...**
The easy ways can improve you as a developer upto some extent but to stay relevant in technology industry you must keep refining and learning yourself. Learning random stuffs that come across your way makes you knowledgable but won't much help in your career aspirations. While goal oriented learning can make a huge difference to your career. There are so many online learning platform that offers great courses in different streams. [Udemy](http://udemy.com/), [Udacity](https://www.udacity.com/), [Egghead.io](https://egghead.io/), [Pluralsight](https://www.pluralsight.com/), [Codecademy](https://www.codecademy.com/), [Coursera](https://www.coursera.org/), [Edx](https://www.edx.org/), [MIT on YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/user/MIT), [FreeCodeCamp](https://www.freecodecamp.org/), and [MongoDB University](https://university.mongodb.com/) are some of the popular online platforms that offers courses and certifications.

Based on your career preference and interests you can learn following technologies or tools as a goal oriented learning.

#### **Frontend Technologies**
Frontend is no more just about HTML, CSS and jQuery. Evolution of JavaScript and JavaScript based frameworks is phenominal in the last 7-8 years.

**JavaScript**
How one can ignore/avoid this language when it is consistently breaking records and surpassing many languages in popularity. In [Stackoverflow's 2017 survey JavaScript remained the most popular language](https://insights.stackoverflow.com/survey/2017#technology-programming-languages) amongst the developers for 5th consequitive year! The latest version of JavaScript also known as ECMAScript 6 makes it lot more advanced and fun language to work with. Arrow functions, spread opertors, shorthand function syntax, Fetch API, Promises are just few cool examples that are still hard to imagine in some of the most popular server side languages.

 - [JavaScript Basics by Udacity](https://in.udacity.com/course/javascript-basics--ud804)
 - [Understand JavaScript on Udemy](https://www.udemy.com/understand-javascript/)

**React**
React by Facebook is the most popular javascript library to develop Single Page Applications (SPA). Manipulating DOM is the most slowest and performance bottleneck operation even in modern web technology. React uses [Virtual DOM](https://www.codecademy.com/articles/react-virtual-dom) to fix the DOM manipulation issue and that's why it feels blazing fast on view layer. Learning React requires you to learn ES6, JSX and JavaScript compilers like Babel. Learning React would help you to develop mobile apps as well, as React also provides native libraries to develop applications for iOS and Android devices.

- [Awesome React - A collection of awesome things regarding React ecosystem](https://github.com/enaqx/awesome-react)

**Vuejs**
Vuejs is a framework to develop Single Page Applications. IMO, Vuejs will surpass the React popularity soon. You might be surprised but Vuejs is the most starred repo after the React, not the Angular. Vuejs is a mix of both Angular (1.x) and React worlds. It also provides [routing](https://github.com/vuejs/vue-router) and [state management](https://github.com/vuejs/vuex) libraries like the React does.

- [Awesome Vue - A curated list of awesome things related to Vue.js](https://github.com/vuejs/awesome-vue)

**Angular**
Angular and AngularJS are two different worlds. Angular is new framework by Google to develop Single Page Applications. The framework requires you to learn TypeScript to work with. If we ignore the Github star ratings then Angular is another most popular framework after React. The Angular provides full fledged framework that includes routing, templating, HTTP, Forms just everything you require to develop a scalable web app.

#### **Task Runners and Application Bundlers**
Projects developed using front-end technologies like Angular, React, Vuejs etc requires some kind of task automation and bundling solution. There come Gulp, Webpack or Parcel into the picture. For the easy start, I would recommend to learn Gulp first.

**[Gulp](https://gulpjs.com/)**
Gulp is task runner that helps you to automate your repetitive taks like saas to css, file concatanation, minification, uglification, source map generation, etc. Including [Gulp + Browsersync](https://browsersync.io/docs/gulp) in your saas development workflow will enable you to get instant style changes inside browsers.

**[Webpack](https://webpack.js.org/)**
Webpack is a module bundler that scans through your dependency graph and generate a single bundler file. Webpack is most popular amongst React developers. I'm a bit inexperienced on this topic right now.

**[Parcel](https://parceljs.org/)**
Parcel is also a web application bundler. It is relatively new entrant in the market but looks quite promising and may surpass popularity of webpack very soon.

#### **Server Technologies**
**Node.js**
Node.js is simply JavaScript on server side technology. In fact, it is very easy to get up and running with Node.js. Node.js is [widely adopted technology by top most companies](https://medium.com/@pedchenko/top-5-companies-using-nodejs-in-production-9c9e0df4e8ab) like Netflix, Uber, PayPal, Ebay and Microsoft on a global scale.

**[GraphQL](http://graphql.org/)**
This is considered to be a next big thing after REST APIs. GraphQL is a query language developed by Facebook. GraphQL can be thought of as specification only. There are GraphQL clients which strictly adheres to the GraphQL specification and provides tools for different frameworks and technology. GraphQL provides a single endpoint to query data in contrast to REST API where you're supposed to write N number of endpoints for your N number of permutations and combinations for your data requirement on frontend side. There are two popular solutions out there [Relay by Facebook](https://facebook.github.io/relay/) and [Apollo GraphQL](https://www.apollographql.com/). But before diving into any of them one should understand the specification in general.

#### **Databases**
No-SQL databases are in top demand. The flexibility to horizontally scale them makes No-SQL database a good fit for big data. Pick [MongoDB](https://www.mongodb.com/) or [RethinkDB](https://www.rethinkdb.com/) if you're just starting up.

You can also explore Redis and RabittMQ. Redis can be used as a caching store, message broker or in-memory database, while RabittMQ is a message broker only.

- [MongoDB University](https://university.mongodb.com/)

#### **Cloud Platforms & Services**
Cloud is almost everywhere now. Companies are moving toward cloud solution at very fast pace. Learning and clearning certification exams by popular cloud platforms like AWS, Google Cloud, and Microsoft Azure would definitely a career booster.

If you want to start with a small step then I would recommend to learn how you can spin up your own server on [Digital Ocean](https://www.digitalocean.com/). You can not compare it with AWS services but it has got all that a developer needs to learn.

[Elastic Stack](https://www.elastic.co/products) is another great stuff to learn. It provides a cluster of tools that you can use to gather data from multiple sources and then perform search, analyze and visualize them in real-time.

[Apache Kafka](https://kafka.apache.org/) is another big platform that you can explore. Kafka was developed by LinkedIn as a data streaming platform and later it was open sourced. The platform is so powerful that it can process/transform 100 Megabytes of data per second. Imagine you're getting tons of data from multilple sources and you're required to process/transform that before storing into your system. This is where Kafka comes into the picture.

#### **DevOps**
There is no clear definition for DevOps. As for every next company, it means something specific. But in a simple words DevOps is a process to fill the gap between software developers and operations teams to increase the software delivery rate. Although, the role of DevOps engineers varies, there are two common activites which almost all DevOps person do on daily basis are **Automation** and **Continuous Integration**.

You can start with DevOps by learning to automate and implementing CI/CD for your projects. [Jenkins](https://jenkins.io/) is a great tool to start with that will allow you to implement CI/CD for nearly any technology stacks. You can also learn Powershell (Windows) or Shell Scripting along with Jenkins. Since learning to write efficent and secure scripts is must for DevOps guys.

If you're keen to make your career in DevOps then you should learn containerization technolgoies like [Docker](https://www.docker.com/) or Kubernetes, orchastration technologies/tools like [Ansible, Chef, Puppet or SaltStack](https://www.intigua.com/blog/puppet-vs.-chef-vs.-ansible-vs.-saltstack).

Materials:
- [Powershell Microsoft Documentation](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/powershell/)
- [Shell Scripting](https://www.shellscript.sh/)
- [Docker Classroom](http://training.play-with-docker.com/)

Thank you for making this far! I still have much more to mention here, will try to keep this post updated in the future.
