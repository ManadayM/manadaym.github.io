# Personal Finance Audit 2021

The year 2021 will remain very special for me. I took some hard decisions to rethink and reshape my career and personal finance.

On the Personal Finance front, I was concerned with my investment style as it completely lacked the ideal asset allocation. I used to park most of my savings in my savings bank account. This simply means, I was eroding my corpus every year due to inflation.

This guilt of not having a proper financial planning in place was increasing every passing year. Hence, this year (Jul. 2021 ðŸ™Š to be precise), I decided to fix that at any cost. I decided to do goal-based investments with a proper asset allocation in place.

I considerably invested my time to learn personal finance basics from July 2021. If youâ€™d have asked me what is my investment portfolio size in Jul 2021 then I wouldnâ€™t have answered to that question as I had no consolidated view available. Gradually, I prepared my goals with their target year and a consolidated view in a Google Sheet. I also calculated the approx corpus required for each goal.

I also wanted to reduce the number of mutual funds to declutter my portfolio. I decided to stop investments in ELSS funds as my tax saving aspect is being covered by my insurance policies, PPF investment, and daughterâ€™s tuition fees. I also decided not to invest in small cap funds. The plan is to limit 3 mutual funds per goal at max.

From today onward, I plan to review and document my personal finance growth on this space, once a month at the very least. The goal is to track

- What is the worth of my investments for each goal?
- What my asset allocation looks like?
- What are the goals for the next year?
- Do I have enough health insurance and term insurance cover?

## Financial Goals

| Goal | Target Year | Approx. Req. Corpus | Corpus Met | Current Alloc. | Desired Alloc. |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Retirement | 2036 | 30X | 4.3% | 41.76% Equity, 58.24% Debt | 70% Equity, 30% Debt |
| Home (~40% payment) | 2025 | 4X | 49.6% | 0% Equity, 100% Debt | 0% Equity, 100% Debt |
| Daughterâ€™s Higher Education | 2029 | 4X | 21.5% | 6.34% Equity, 93.64% Debt | 50% Equity, 50% Debt |
| Sonâ€™s Higher Education | 2035 | 4X | 3.2% | 26.70% Equity, 73.30% Debt | 70% Equity, 30% Debt |
| Emergency Fund | 2023 | 0.5X | 92.1% | 0% Equity, 100% Debt | 0% Equity, 100% Debt |

Here, X represents my current annual expenses. The *Corpus Met* column represents accumulated corpus which is *Inflation Adjusted*. For example, if today 30X = 1,00,000 INR, then by the next year 30X = 1,08,000 INR due to inflation.

I have considered 8% inflation for each goal except Emergency Fund goal. I kept aside a fixed amount for the Emergency Fund goal that can help me to pay 6 months of expenses. I will try to adjust and bump the inflation number in future if required.

On top of the Emergency Fund, I have reserved (Reserved Cash in the pie chart) another ~0.5X amount that can help me to withdraw monthly expenses and pay SIP amounts for 6 months even when I don't generate any income. I need that margin as my consulting work cannot guarantee that I will earn next month. I hope to improve this side as well by procuring half-yearly or annual work contracts.

### Financial Independence (Retirement)

This goal is to become financially independent. I wish to generate enough returns by that time so that I donâ€™t have to worry about my monthly expenses.

I donâ€™t intend to stop working by the age of 50 (2036). However, planning and saving to retire by this age would provide me a margin of safety. What if I become technically outdated by 2036 that no tech companies want to hire an aged software engineer like me by that time. ðŸ˜‚ 

**Allocation**

The main goal is to reach the desired equity allocation by the end of 2022 and reduce the mutual fund counts gradually. I have already stopped my SIPs in couple of funds but havenâ€™t redeemed my units.

Retirement portfolio allocation.

| Instrument | XIRR | SIP Status |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Mirae Asset Emerging Bluechip Fund (May 2017) | 41.79% | ACTIVE |
| Parag Parikh Flexi Cap Fund (Aug 2020) | 45.79% | ACTIVE |
| Axis Long Term Equity (ELSS) (Nov 2017) | 23.81% | STOPPED |
| DSP Tax Saver Fund (ELSS) (Mar 2017) | 25.78% | STOPPED |
| Axis Focused 25 Fund (Jan 2020) | 33.43% | STOPPED |
| SBI Small Cap Fund (Jan 2020) | 54.29% | STOPPED |
| Franklin India Feeder (US) Fund (Jul 2020) | 21.84% | STOPPED |
| Nifty 50 ETFs (NIFTYBEES) | - | NEW |
| Stocks (Low volatility / Growth) | - | NEW |

I have increased direct stock investments to a considerable percentage of my retirement portfolio from < 1% to 12.4%. The strategy is to invest in a low volatility and/or growth stocks. This will also generate a small dividend income stream. I donâ€™t trade stocks too much but if I see swing trading opportunity then I grab that. Youâ€™ll appreciate my patience after knowing the fact that, Iâ€™m a proud ITC stocks holder since mid 2020 when it was below 190 INR levels. ðŸ˜‚

**Mirae Asset Emerging Bluechip Fund (Invested since May 2017)**

I have mixed feelings for this fund as it has performed very well but the fund house has imposed two major restrictions 1) you cannot invest any lumpsum amount 2) Lately, they restricted SIP amount from 25000 to 2500! I lost a golden opportunity to invest in lumpsum for these reasons when stock market was slumped due to COVID (Mar 2020). I am not sure what to do with this fund and its SIP as of now. The SIP amount is < 10,000 INR per month so will leave it as it is for now.

**Parag Parikh Flexi Cap (Invested since Aug 2020)**

I liked the fund houseâ€™s phiolosophy of value investing. I have watched many lectures of Mr. Parag Parikh on YouTube and theyâ€™re all very insighful from the value investing perspective. Unfortunately, we lost such a gem person due to a tragic accident. However, the fund house is determined to invest based on Mr. Parag Parikhâ€™s value principles. The simplicity can be seen in their MF products as they have very limited funds but each of them have performed very well.

The another best thing is its US equity exposure - Tech stocks like Google, Facebook, Amazon. I truly believe the technology disruptions will continue to happen form the US soil in the years to come. The exposure to US stock market I get through this fund is enough for my current portfolio.

**Nifty 50 ETFs**

IMO, a few fund houses can consistently beat the stock market returns in the long run. This is why, I want to increase my allocation to passive funds for the long term goals (> 10 years). When you invest in an active fund youâ€™re betting on a fund managerâ€™s ability but that might not persist in the long run. Passive funds on the other hand can be thought of as a programmed fund. It just need to copy the index without any bias.

I strongly believe that the ETF market in India will see exponential growth in the coming years as theyâ€™re cheapst and easiest passive instruments to invest.

**EPF**

The accured corpus in the Employee Provident Fund is tagged as the debt portion for now. This means, I wonâ€™t be able to rebalance my portfolio. Iâ€™m okay with that for now as I havenâ€™t even reached to the desired equity allocation. I will withdraw EPF corpus if I stick to my decision of not doing full-time job this year as well. ðŸ˜…

## Daughterâ€™s Higher Education

![Daughterâ€™s higher education portfolio.]({{ site.url }}public/images/2022-01-03-personal-finance-audit-2021/daughters_higher_education.png)

Daughterâ€™s higher education portfolio.

I invested in traditional instrutments for this goal since 2012 like FDs, PPF (opened when my daughter was born), physical gold, and lately the Soverign Gold Bonds. There was no equity exposure for this goal.

This goal is still 7 years away so I have decided to invest roughtly 50% of the portfolio in a hybrid aggresive fund. I have created an STP by parking the fixed deposit proceeds in a liquid fund. The STP will transfer a fixed amount every month to the hybrid fund. I was not comfortable to deploy all money into equity in a shot due to the market volatility and uncertainity. On top of the STP, I have started monthly SIP that will invest in the same fund. I will reduce the allocation as the target year approaches.

The PPF account will mature by Apr 2027 and I donâ€™t plan to extend it. I will park all proceeds into a liquid fund for the next 3 years. This would give indexation benefit on the liquid fund returns. Well, this is what I think and plan as of now. Letâ€™s see how it goes by time.

## Sonâ€™s Higher Education

![Sonâ€™s higher education portfolio.]({{ site.url }}public/images/2022-01-03-personal-finance-audit-2021/sons_higher_education.png)

I had no investments for this goal. We (I and my wife) accumulated all amount for my son in a savings bank account. In Sep 2021, I moved that corpus into a liquid fund and created an STP against it for 12 months.

I have also started monthly investments in the NIFTY 50 ETFs since this goal is 14 years away. The reserved cash is a reserved balance for the next 6 months of SIP amount because of a little uncertainty of my income. I hope to improve for my income stream and reduce this reserved fund requirements.

## Home Goal

![Home Goal.]({{ site.url }}public/images/2022-01-03-personal-finance-audit-2021/Home_Goal.png)

This is very unclear goal, I have. I am not keen to buy a residential property. I strongly feel buying a residential property (flat) is a dead investment.

Buying a residential property means

- I will loose my savings that can potentially generate a nice cashflow in the coming years.
- I will loose the flexibility to swiftly decide and shift to a new city, state, or country.
- I will have to manage its maintenance, pay property tax, etc.
- I will also have to take housing loan as aquiring a residential property in India is a costly affair. However, the rental yield is very low in India that means I can rent out a costly residential property at lower rentals.

I have had parked the accumulated funds (~3X) for this goal in fixed deposits. They are maturing in the coming months. We (I and my wife) will decide what to do with this goal in the coming months.

I also plan to surrender my traditional endowment LIC policies. I have already purchased term insurance plans to cover the pure risk. The traditional endowment plans neither provides you suffcient risk cover nor it provides you inflation beating. I will surrender 3 policies out of 4 which are now 10+ years old. I will get whatever bonus accured and the full premiums paid.

## Other goals

### Health Insurance

I plant to buy a top-up plan this year. My health insurance plan might not be sufficient. It covers 0.5X amount as of now. I plan to increase that to roughly 2X.

### Mindless Expenses

I and my wife started tracking our outflow/expenses to find if there are any expenses that we can reduce/avoid in the years to come. We religiously tracked it in 2021 full year and have identified some areas where we can improve.

For example, we found that our annual expenses for snacks (chocolates, ice-creams, and street food) were around 20,000 INR! That roughly translates to 2000 INR per month. I donâ€™t want to avoid spending that amount but if we divert that expenses towards more healthy stuff like fruits and dry-fruits then itâ€™ll improve our health as well. Letâ€™s see how it goes this year. ðŸ˜…

### Crypto

I am following and understanding the crypto space since early 2021. I have restrainted myself from investing in that space out of FOMO. I have already opened my account with Vauld but havenâ€™t done anything after that. 

It seems to me that thereâ€™s a considerable social consensus that Bitcoin is a [Store of Value](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/s/storeofvalue.asp) due to its inbuilt scarcity characteristics. My logic is simple that those who mine Bitcoin has to invest in sophisticated hardwares and pay for hefty electricity costs. Since the mining process involves the time and resources to mine new coins it derives its value from there. Thatâ€™s my logic to convince myself that I should at least take small positions in the crypto space. ðŸ¤‘ðŸ˜‚

I would start investing (monthly) in Bitcoin, Ethereum, Solana, and couple of metaverse tokens. I will invest max 1-2% of my total portfolio.

## TODO

- [ ]  Health insurance top-up.
- [ ]  Surrender endowment policies.
- [ ]  Terminate inoperative bank account and debit cards.
