## Encryption

Encryption is the process of scrambling or changing a message to hide the original text.

## Decryption

Decryption is the process of unscrambling a message to retrieve the original text.

## Symmetric Encryption

When the sender and the receiver share the same key to encrypt and decrypt a message it’s called symmetric encryption. This approach requires both the party’s to agree upon a secret key ahead of time in private. This doesn’t help for two computers to secretly meet and decide on a private key as they’re on a public network i.e. Internet.

## Asymmetric Encryption

This approach involves two mathematically related keys a public key and a private key. A public key can be exchanged with anybody. This key can/will be used to scramble the data. The private key, on the other side, is kept secret by the user to decrypt the message that was encrypted with his/her private key.
