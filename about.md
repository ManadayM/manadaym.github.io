#### Year 2000-2007

Computer used to be a luxury in India in the early 2000 and did not get chance to explore it due to multiple reasons. Fast forward to 2003, I fell in love with computers when I first used it during my graduation days in Commerce stream. Yes, you read it right - graduation days and a Commerce background fellow. I decided to make my career in the field of IT and joined Master of Computer Application program in 2007.

#### Year 2010

In Jan 2010, I joined Nomadic Solutions, a small company in online Mobile and DTH recharge business, as a Trainee .NET Developer. I with my other 2 colleagues developed a web portal for online recharge from the scratch. I learnt many new things in ASP.Net and SQL server.

July 2010 brought another great opportunity to me from Investis and I just grabbed it. I joined Investis as a .NET developer but in few months I was asked to start exploring Apps Development. That was the end of .NET journey and beginning of the new journey in Apps Development. Again, learnt many things and executed 4 successful mobile app products/projects.

#### Year 2016-Present

My employer tasked me with another new project but this time it was for Web and not for mobile app! New turning point. I was supposed to learn and implement AngularJS for the next big project - [MYINVETIS v5](https://dashboard.myinvestis.com).

I'm enjoying this age's drastically changing Web Development stacks - credit goes to jQuery, BackboneJS, AngularJS and the NodeJS.

#### I do these days:

* Freelance MEAN Stack projects in free-time
* [Learning Salesforce](https://trailhead.salesforce.com/en/users/profiles/00550000007ICZ8AAO)
* Learning ES6

#### I want to learn:

So many things... *React*, *Vue.js*, and *IoT*. The list is evolving.
