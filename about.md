#### Year 2000-2007

Computer used to be a luxury in India in the early 2000 and did not get chance to explore it due to multiple reasons. Fast forward to 2003, I fell in love with computers when I first used it during my graduation days in Commerce stream. Yes, you read it right - graduation days and a Commerce background fellow. I decided to make my career in the field of IT and joined Master of Computer Application program in 2007.

#### Year 2010

By January 2010, I successfully completed my 5 semsters with average first class grade. I learnt so many programming languages and technologies but only liked .NET and PHP those days. I joined Nomadic Solutions, a small company in online Mobile and DTH recharge business, as a trainee .NET Developer. I with my other 2 collagues developed a web portal for online recharge from the scratch. I learnt so many new things in ASP.Net and SQL server which I never even imagined during the college days. By now you'd have guessed Indian education system. :(

July 2010 brought another great opportunity to me from Investis and I just grabbed it. Joined Investis as a .NET developer but in few months I was asked to start exploring Apps Development. That was the end of .NET journey and beggining of the new journey in Apps Development. Again, learnt many things and executed 3 succesful mobile apps as a product for Investis.

#### Year 2016-Present

My employer tasked me with another new project from scratch but this time it was for Web and not mobile apps! Yes, the new turning point. I was supposed to learn and implement AngularJS for the next big project - [MYINVETIS v5](https://dashboard.myinvestis.com). I'm enjoying the drastically changed the Web Development stacks these days - credit goes to jQuery, BackboneJS, AngularJS and the most important one NodeJS.

Personally, I kept on learning the full stack web dev - the MEAN Stack. I delivered 2 good and mid sized MEAN stack based projects as a freelancer in my free time.
