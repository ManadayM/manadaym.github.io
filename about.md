I'm an IT professional with over 11 years of experience in enterprise-grade software products development. I'm passionate about creating performant, accessible, secure, and privacy-first web platforms and mobile applications.

I write technical articles on this space to help others to improve Code Quality, Web Performance, and Web Accessibility. I'd be happy to be corrected if you find something posted here is inaccurate. Please drop me a note on any social channel, I'm easily reachable. ðŸ˜Š
